    <p>
      This uses the
      <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/aws-ip-ranges.html">AWS IP Ranges JSON file</a>
      to determine if a given IP address is used by AWS and if so what service(s) and region(s) it is
      allocated to. This information is not particularly precise and the most common services that will
      be seen are CloudFront and EC2 (though there are other values!).
    </p>
    <p>
      When a hostname is entered, rather than directly looking the value up in the JSON file, the
      <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/make-api-requests/dns-json/">Cloudflare DNS over HTTPS API</a>
      is used to get the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the given domain. Only <code>A</code> and
      <code>AAAA</code> records will be checked.
